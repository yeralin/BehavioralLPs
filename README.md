**S:** Ever since I joined Amazon, it's been bothering me how engineering teams track their project progress. Typically, it is engineers creating one-liner tasks (like "Update schema for XYZ table") and managers maintaining their convoluted spreadsheet. This resulted in multitude of issues, starting from managers struggling to backtrack their teams work and estimate remaining work, ending with engineers working in silos and having no visibility or understanding of what their peers are working on.

**T:** When I started managing my engineering team, my first goal was to get rid of these inadequate workflows and introduce a new process according to modern agile practices. My goal was to make our work measureable, predictable and standardized. I read a few books and articles about scrum framework and agile software development, and watched lectures on the topic. I wanted to understand not just how to organize these practices, but the underlining reason behind it. For example, I learned that Scoping meetings are not just used to assign points to a story and estimate the workload, but actually let the entire team learn about the task on hand while they may not necessarily be the one to actually work on it. Another goal I set for myself was that I would like to make it flexible, not just follow the book, and work together with the team and establish the process that would work for everyone, adjust it and experiment with it as we go.

**A:** I secured access to Asana work management tool for my team, build initial structure for our backlog, sprint boards, established templates for dev stories and spikes, and wrote first few stories to lead by example. Next, I created a comprehensive internal wiki article where I outlined the proposed agile process. I kept it simple and to bear bones, sprint planning, standups, scoping and retrospective. I clearly articulated roles and responsibilities. Next day, I held a learning session where I shared my new proposed workflow with my engineering team.

**R:** Although initially, I saw hesitation to use the new tools, I knew that the team will take time to adjust. I continued leading by example, hosting/leading all ceremonies and writing stories for everyone, but eventually started delegating and requesting engineers write their own stories. During 1:1s I would solicit feedback on the process as well as explain the accountability aspects of the new process. We started with relatively low completion rate 40% of planned stories, but I knew that this is the callibration period while the engineering team is getting used to the new workflow. This number started steadily growing up as we progressed. Asana also provided helpful metrics into how our team and each individual contributor is performing. Engineers loved the new process as it was evident from Connection Scores (based on increased 90%+ Job Satisfaction and Manager Skills/Satisfaction metrics), as engineers stopped working in silos and had visibility into what rest of the team is working on. This also increased mobility, as now engineers could pick up each other tasks and grow their expertise in other areas of our systems. The word spread, and other engineering managers started asking me how to replicate the process. Eventually, our Engineering Director requested me to host an org-wide Knowledge Sharing session on and asking other teams to adopt our team's agile processes.

**Reflection:** This experience has taught me how challenging it is to confront status quo, meet initial resistance, but with perseverance in trying to establish new, positive practices eventually pays back ten fold. Being open to feedback and willing to continuously adjust and refine my approach was crucial for my team's long-term success.

**S:** At Amazon teams operate according to goals of different levels. For example, S-team goal is one of the most important ones since it is coming from the senior leadership level. Our project was part of an S-team goal to deliver 4 upper funnel metrics. Our team was responsible for delivering Brand Lift metric which would tell you brand awareness levels of your brand using combination of RCT (Randomized Control Trial) A/B experiments and Modeled Brand Lift estimations. The metrics were supposed to be included as part of the Summary Campaign Reports that typically receive majority of traffic from advertisers at Amazon Ads.
However, a month before the release, I received news that the entire S-team goal was deprioritized, and our metric was no longer to be exposed on the report. Instead, the direction from leadership was that we take a pivot and integrate our metric as part of our Studies page which would take at least another 3 months to complete. I quickly realized that it would be very demoralizing news for my engineering team since they were working hard for the past 6 months to deliver this metric, and many have already anticipated that after the launch the team can take a breather and work on awaited Operational Excellence tasks under less strict timelines.

**T:** My task was to break the news to my team yet to deliver it in a form where they would not lose motivation and lose morale from the fact that their project will extend for another three months.

**A:** First, I worked closely with my Product Manager to brainstorm and pinpoint the Pivot plan. During our analysis, we discovered that by integrating with Studies page that we own, it will give us better insights into how our metrics are being used by customers. As opposed to the Summary Report where we would not get any information on how often our metrics are being accessed and used. Another revelation was that by integrating with the Studies page it would resolve a long-standing technical debt problem that had being bugging our team for a while. This new methodology to Brand Lift measurement would effectively deprecate all other old methodologies, and our PM gave us a green light to simply remove all of them.

**R:** Armed with these insights, I crafted a careful message to my team that I shared during all team meeting where I broke the news to my team about the Pivot plan, and while they were still processing the implications, I shared the findings and communicated that since Amazon is prominent for being Customer Obsessed, we are doing right by our customer by taking the Pivot. It would give us better insights into how our product is being used and give us more feedback to continue quickly iterating and improving our product. I was interjected by one of my SDEs, asking about what would happen regarding our Operational Excellence tasks slated for the remaining of the year. Since I anticipated this question, I also shared the good news with them that with this Pivot, we would deprecate all other Brand Lift solutions effectively eliminating the outstanding tech debt. After, I saw the smiles on my engineers faces, I knew that I delivered the message in the right way. 

**Reflection:** This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of patience and thorough analysis before communicating changes. By taking the time to fully understand the implications and craft a clear action plan, I was able to guide the team more effectively through the transition, ultimately maintaining their trust and motivation.

>
> Reflection:

> * Don't be another problem, be part of solution
> * Deconstruct the problem and find path forward 

**S:** There was a situation where my product team committed to a sudden switch in deliverables with unrealistic timelines. I was asked to pause all ongoing projects in favor of this one which was orthogonal to what we were doing.

**T:** It involved introducing so called Path to Conversion metric which can be calculated using available traffic data and build a chronological line of exposure events that eventually led to a conversion. The timelines were overly aggressive, where we had to deliver this project within next 3 months. The good part was that the design was already completed, and I needed to carry out the execution portion of it.

**A:** Instead of rejecting and pushing back this aggressive deliverable right away, I initiated the discussion with my product team. I explained that with such aggressive timelines my team is very likely to not meet the deadline. The product team told me that this sudden reprioritization came from our SVP of Ads which effectivelly gives me a cart-blanche on the resourcing and approvals, where I can lend engineers from sister teams for this project.
I worked further with my product team where we clarified functional requirements and features for this project. After getting those in writing, I worked with my Sr Engineer where we went through the design doc and requirements, and t-shirt sized proposed features.

**R:** I prepared a WBP for my product team where I estimated delivery dates for the project with all proposed features. In its entirety according to my plan, the project would estimated to be delivered in 6 months timeline, but I worked together with the product team to identify which set of features can be prioritized first as Phase 0 and which can be pushed back to Phase 1. By identifying feature set required for phase 0 (effectivelly an MVP), me and the product team managed to arrive to the original requirement of delivering the project within 3 months. Once everyone was aligned, my team initiated the implementation phase and delivered the project within the alloted timeline.

**Reflection:** That experience tought me a few important things. Even when it is obvious that proposed project has unrealistic expectations, you should not immediatelly take defensive stance. You should not make more trouble, but be a part of a solution by deconstructing a problem piece by piece and try to finding a right path forward.

**S:** The most successful product-engineering partnership happens when engineering is involved from the beginning in the ideation step. Because typically, the project proposals come very late in the year, and engineering team does not have an opportunity to perform technical feasibility test or build a proof of concept. It typically results in cutting corners in order to meet project deliverable. It is a common complaint from engineering teams at Amazon. Since I am very close with our product manager Jay, and we respect each other as partners. I've discussed that issue with Jay quite extensively. I've requested to get me involved in the process as soon as technically possible. 

**T:** That resulted in the very early stage where typically engineering teams are not directly involved as it covers competitive and market analysis. The idea was so ambigous that having more voices was almost counter productive. That's when the idea of expanding our surveying capabilities beyond Shopper Panel came along. We wanted to collect surveys from other mediums such as Twitch streams, IMDB TV and Prime Video platforms. Being involved in the process so early gave me an advantage to perform a quick POC and having ability to veto or green light it before it was approved.

**A:** I've reached out to an old friend of mine who was working on Twitch side of things and ran the idea by him. While discussing the idea, I quickly realized that a potential issue might be the Twitch-Amazon userbase overlap. The problem is that in order to run Amazon Brand Lift we required demographics data which typically came with Amazon user data, but on Twitch-side they were not collecting such. I came back with my findings to my product manager, and we decided to do a quick overlap analysis with Twitch userbase before proposing the idea to our leadership. I created a live document collecting my technical feasibility findings and shared it with my PM. Then, I requested our BIE to perform such analysis to find out how many Twitch users can be linked back to their Amazon accounts.

**R:** After a few days, I received the results that nearly 35% of Twitch users are also identifiable Amazon customers. That's when I involved our senior enginer and the PM where together we brainstormed around this number and estimated that with a larger amount of surveys we could collect enough data to perform Brand Lift analysis with similar statistical strength despite low overlap. I quickly estimated Infra costs required for issuing increased amount of surveys which was significant compared to our current IMR spend. However, together with the PM we offset it by saved survey rewards since on Twitch it would be non-incentive based surveys. With that offset, overall we would be saving the budget. Once we both were aligned, I helped the PM draft up the final proposal that he then presented to our senior leadership and got it approved. By doing so, I ensured a few things, first the idea was properly evaluated for its technical feasibility before being prioritized by our leadership, second engineering team became aware of the upcoming project ahead of time which led it to already start thinking on the implementation details ahead of time.

**Reflection:** This experience tought me that if you see that something is not working, propose changing it (Bezos said that good intentions don't work, good mechanisms do). In this case, our product and leadership teams did not want to give technically unfeasible projects to eng teams and set them up for failure. They had good intentions that came very late in the pipeline which impacted engineering teams later on. By getting myself involved very early in the process, not only I was able to perform early technical feasibility and enhance the process, I also learned how product teams come up with ideas and now better understand their processes. Me and the PM shared our learnings with our leadership team which became a template for success across our organization. I documented this engagement model and shared it with other engineering managers to adopt in the upcoming year.

**S:** 
* My team had a year-long project that involved surfacing Amazon Brand Lift metrics on the main Amazon Ads reporting page
* There advertisers access all metrics regarding performance of their advertising campaigns. 
* Prior, we were hosting our Amazon Brand Lift application on a separate page, where advertisers can create a so-called Study, attach campaigns they would like to measure and wait for results. 

**T:** 
* In this project, the task was to expose Brand Lift in a form of a single metric as part of the report.
* What was complicating the task that our Brand Lift metric is not aggregatable across dates (i.e. Brand Lift on Day 1 cannot be simply added to Brand Lift metric on Day 2), and Amazon Ads reporting layer could not work with such metrics.
* Another challenge, was that this work required integrating with 7 different internal services/teams and involved many reviews, approvals, and red taping.

**A:** 
* Having reservations regarding this aggregation limitation, I applied the famous mechanism at Amazon called Working Backwards, where instead of building bottom-up and integrating with the first service.
* I started our journey by talking to the team owners of the last service in the chain, the reporting layer.
* I shared my reservations regarding the limitation, however their Engineering Manager assured me that we can peform additional calculations within their service which would effectively alleviate the problem.
* With that confirmation, we continued our work which lasted almost 9 months of planning, approvals, design, and implementation work.
* Once my team reached the final step of integrating with the reporting layear, I found out that original manager has departed Amazon.
* The successor surprised us with a refusal to add our calculation logic, citing introducing tech debt for their team.

**R:** 
* The project became red and immediately halted, requiring an escalation at the directors level. 
* After prolonged discussions everybody agreed on two things:
1. It was a fair concern, and while they are ready to give us an exception to introduce our logic, it would not be a good long-term solution.
2. They also recongnized that it is not our fault, but a major limitation of Amazon Ads' reporting layer, where our competitors (Meta and Google) already support aggregating such metrics.
* With that conclusion, I decided to Pivot and instead extend the Studies page to surface these metrics.
* I personally continued to drive the long-term discussions of enhancing the reporting layer at the directors level, helping them gather use-cases and requirements.
* With this Pivot, however, our delivery date shifted by 3 months, as now we needed additional planning and reprioritization of tasks and resources.
* But in the end we managed to release this new feature to our customers alas not where we initially planned it to be.

**Reflection**: 
* Looking back, my error in judgment was relying solely on the verbal assurance from the original Engineering Manager without securing a documented consensus
* or technical feasibility assessment involving their senior engineering members.
* Another lesson learned was having plan B readily available, and being ready to pivot without any delay.
* Since this experience, I've introduced formal documentation and alignment processes in cross-team engagements
* and always having contingency plans for complex projects.

**S:**
* I was given a proposal document outlining an idea to collect ad exposure data from panelists using VPN profiles
* The idea was questionable from the privacy perspective, and included a section to cover for a potential PR risk by hiring an independent consulting firm to analyze the final solution

**T:**
* I was tasked with evaluating the technical feasibility of the project and executing it (design, planning, implementation, etc.)
* I found out that they wanted to collect data on where and when panelists get exposed to Amazon ads, the data were to be used for future modeling based targeting (with impending loss of cookies and other identifiers)

**A:**
* I came up with an alternative idea of using DNS profiles instead, as it would allow us to collect the same data without any loss in measurement quality
* However, it would be harder to execute from the technical standpoint
* The changes to this proposal document this late in the process would have been highly risky and not met positively by leaderish, but I truly believed that if we are trully Customer Obsessed company by taking this pivot we would be doing right by our customer
* I worked closely with one of my engineers to perform a quick PoC. Since I have a strong networking background, I explained my idea to him and by doing a few pair programming sessions we confirmed that we can collect the same data using DNS profiles without any drop in measurement quality

**R:**
* I drafted up the pivot plan and presented it to the product team which was initially met skeptically as with this plan they would have to go through another round of privacy and leadership approvals
* I defended my position claiming that by taking this pivot and using DNS approach instead of VPN profiles, we would be (1) doing right by our customer and not introduce any potential privacy issues, and (2) we wouldn't have to hire any independent contractors to analyze our solution, as with DNS approach it would be pretty easy to see that we are only collecting Amazon Ads related data
* With that I managed to convince my product team and leadership to take this pivot, ultimatelly the project was delayed by an extra month but to this day everyone agrees that it was a right decision to make

**Reflection:**
* This experience has taught me that even if you might not be a fan of the idea, you can be the one to turn it into a positive outcome
* Being Customer Obsessed not only pays off for our customers, but also pays off on your own work. If I was not Customer Obsessed I would have continued with the initial, suboptimal idea and eventually it would lead to higher reputational risks for the company as well as privacy risks for our customers
