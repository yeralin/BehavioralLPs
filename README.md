* My name is Daniyar Yeralin, and I am an engineering manager and technical leader of a highly performant team of 8 software engineers.
* My team owns quite a few products, but mainly customer-facing Shopper Panel app with 600K DAU, and advertiser-facing Amazon Brand Lift product to measure upper-funnel Brand Awareness levels.
* I've been managing this team for over 2 years, directly contributed to peoples career advancements which resulted in three promotions to middle level and one promotion to senior level. 
* My management style is a playing coach, where I can jump in pair programming sessions with my engineers or discuss and provide low level feedback on their code or architecture designs
* I established a highly performing and flexible agile practices, where my team consistently delivers 90% of estimated developer stories sprint-over-sprint
  * This success brought attention from my senior leadership at Amazon, where they asked me to expand and share this practice across other engineering teams in my organization
* I champion and directly contribute to operational success of my engineering team
  * For example, in order to facilitate Sprint Planning, I created an LLM tool that my team can use to generate developer stories. All they need to do is to point the LLM bot to a Slack thread or email chain, and based on the context it would generate a dev story according to our template
  * In moments, when my team is strained, I don't hesistate to become hands-on and help them by squashing smaller tasks or help investigating system failures

**S:** Ever since I joined Amazon, it's been bothering me how engineering teams track their project progress. Typically, it is engineers creating one-liner tasks (like "Update schema for XYZ table") and managers maintaining their convoluted spreadsheet. This resulted in multitude of issues, starting from managers struggling to backtrack their teams work and estimate remaining work, ending with engineers working in silos and having no visibility or understanding of what their peers are working on.

**T:** When I started managing my engineering team, my first goal was to get rid of these inadequate workflows and introduce a new process according to modern agile practices. My goal was to make our work measureable, predictable and standardized. I read a few books and articles about scrum framework and agile software development, and watched lectures on the topic. I wanted to understand not just how to organize these practices, but the underlining reason behind it. For example, I learned that Scoping meetings are not just used to assign points to a story and estimate the workload, but actually let the entire team learn about the task on hand while they may not necessarily be the one to actually work on it. Another goal I set for myself was that I would like to make it flexible, not just follow the book, and work together with the team and establish the process that would work for everyone, adjust it and experiment with it as we go.

**A:** I secured access to Asana work management tool for my team, build initial structure for our backlog, sprint boards, established templates for dev stories and spikes, and wrote first few stories to lead by example. Next, I created a comprehensive internal wiki article where I outlined the proposed agile process. I kept it simple and to bear bones, sprint planning, standups, scoping and retrospective. I clearly articulated roles and responsibilities. Next day, I held a learning session where I shared my new proposed workflow with my engineering team.

**R:** Although initially, I saw hesitation to use the new tools, I knew that the team will take time to adjust. I continued leading by example, hosting/leading all ceremonies and writing stories for everyone, but eventually started delegating and requesting engineers write their own stories. During 1:1s I would solicit feedback on the process as well as explain the accountability aspects of the new process. We started with relatively low completion rate 40% of planned stories, but I knew that this is the callibration period while the engineering team is getting used to the new workflow. This number started steadily growing up as we progressed. Asana also provided helpful metrics into how our team and each individual contributor is performing. Engineers loved the new process as it was evident from Connection Scores (based on increased 90%+ Job Satisfaction and Manager Skills/Satisfaction metrics), as engineers stopped working in silos and had visibility into what rest of the team is working on. This also increased mobility, as now engineers could pick up each other tasks and grow their expertise in other areas of our systems. The word spread, and other engineering managers started asking me how to replicate the process. Eventually, our Engineering Director requested me to host an org-wide Knowledge Sharing session on and asking other teams to adopt our team's agile processes.

**Reflection:** This experience has taught me how challenging it is to confront status quo, meet initial resistance, but with perseverance in trying to establish new, positive practices eventually pays back ten fold. Being open to feedback and willing to continuously adjust and refine my approach was crucial for my team's long-term success.

**S:** At Amazon teams operate according to goals of different levels. For example, S-team goal is one of the most important ones since it is coming from the senior leadership level. Our project was part of an S-team goal to deliver 4 upper funnel metrics. Our team was responsible for delivering Brand Lift metric which would tell you brand awareness levels of your brand using combination of RCT (Randomized Control Trial) A/B experiments and Modeled Brand Lift estimations. The metrics were supposed to be included as part of the Summary Campaign Reports that typically receive majority of traffic from advertisers at Amazon Ads.
However, a month before the release, I received news that the entire S-team goal was deprioritized, and our metric was no longer to be exposed on the report. Instead, the direction from leadership was that we take a pivot and integrate our metric as part of our Studies page which would take at least another 3 months to complete. I quickly realized that it would be very demoralizing news for my engineering team since they were working hard for the past 6 months to deliver this metric, and many have already anticipated that after the launch the team can take a breather and work on awaited Operational Excellence tasks under less strict timelines.

**T:** My task was to break the news to my team yet to deliver it in a form where they would not lose motivation and lose morale from the fact that their project will extend for another three months.

**A:** First, I worked closely with my Product Manager to brainstorm and pinpoint the Pivot plan. During our analysis, we discovered that by integrating with Studies page that we own, it will give us better insights into how our metrics are being used by customers. As opposed to the Summary Report where we would not get any information on how often our metrics are being accessed and used. Another revelation was that by integrating with the Studies page it would resolve a long-standing technical debt problem that had being bugging our team for a while. This new methodology to Brand Lift measurement would effectively deprecate all other old methodologies, and our PM gave us a green light to simply remove all of them.

**R:** Armed with these insights, I crafted a careful message to my team that I shared during all team meeting where I broke the news to my team about the Pivot plan, and while they were still processing the implications, I shared the findings and communicated that since Amazon is prominent for being Customer Obsessed, we are doing right by our customer by taking the Pivot. It would give us better insights into how our product is being used and give us more feedback to continue quickly iterating and improving our product. I was interjected by one of my SDEs, asking about what would happen regarding our Operational Excellence tasks slated for the remaining of the year. Since I anticipated this question, I also shared the good news with them that with this Pivot, we would deprecate all other Brand Lift solutions effectively eliminating the outstanding tech debt. After, I saw the smiles on my engineers faces, I knew that I delivered the message in the right way. 

**Reflection:** This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of patience and thorough analysis before communicating changes. By taking the time to fully understand the implications and craft a clear action plan, I was able to guide the team more effectively through the transition, ultimately maintaining their trust and motivation.

#### Shorter Answer (ChatGPT)
**S:** At Amazon, our team was tasked with delivering a Brand Lift metric as part of an S-team goal. However, a month before the release, leadership decided to deprioritize this initiative, and we were directed to pivot our efforts to integrate the metric into the Studies page, extending our timeline by three months. I knew this change would be demoralizing for my team, who had been working hard for six months with the expectation of completing this milestone.

**T:** My task was to communicate this reframe it in a way that kept the team motivated and aligned with the new direction while addressing their concerns about workload and timelines.

**A:** First, I collaborated with my Product Manager to analyze the benefits of the pivot. We discovered that integrating with the Studies page would provide better insights into how our metrics were used by customers and also eliminate long-standing technical debt. Armed with this, I crafted a clear and empathetic message, presenting the pivot as a customer-obsessed decision aligned with Amazon's principles. I anticipated concerns about delayed operational tasks, so I addressed this directly, explaining how the pivot would actually resolve technical debt and streamline future operations.

**R:** When I communicated the pivot to the team, I framed it as an opportunity to better serve our customers while simultaneously improving our technical infrastructure. Although there was initial hesitation, I handled questions openly, particularly around the impact on our operational tasks. Once I reassured them that this shift would lead to eliminating technical debt, I saw positive reactions and a renewed sense of purpose. The team embraced the change, and we moved forward with a clear focus on delivering the best outcome for our customers. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of patience and thorough analysis before communicating changes. By taking the time to fully understand the implications and craft a clear action plan, I was able to guide the team more effectively through the transition, ultimately maintaining their trust and motivation.

**S:** 
* My team had a year-long project that involved surfacing Amazon Brand Lift metrics on the main Amazon Ads reporting page
* There advertisers access all metrics regarding performance of their advertising campaigns. 
* Prior, we were hosting our Amazon Brand Lift application on a separate page, where advertisers can create a so-called Study, attach campaigns they would like to measure and wait for results. 

**T:** 
* In this project, the task was to expose Brand Lift in a form of a single metric as part of the report.
* What was complicating the task that our Brand Lift metric is not aggregatable across dates (i.e. Brand Lift on Day 1 cannot be simply added to Brand Lift metric on Day 2), and Amazon Ads reporting layer could not work with such metrics.
* Another challenge, was that this work required integrating with 7 different internal services/teams and involved many reviews, approvals, and red taping.

**A:** 
* Having reservations regarding this aggregation limitation, I applied the famous mechanism at Amazon called Working Backwards, where instead of building bottom-up and integrating with the first service.
* I started our journey by talking to the team owners of the last service in the chain, the reporting layer.
* I shared my reservations regarding the limitation, however their Engineering Manager assured me that we can peform additional calculations within their service which would effectively alleviate the problem.
* With that confirmation, we continued our work which lasted almost 9 months of planning, approvals, design, and implementation work.
* Once my team reached the final step of integrating with the reporting layear, I found out that original manager has departed Amazon.
* The successor surprised us with a refusal to add our calculation logic, citing introducing tech debt for their team.

**R:** 
* The project became red and immediately halted, requiring an escalation at the directors level. 
* After prolonged discussions everybody agreed on two things:
1. It was a fair concern, and while they are ready to give us an exception to introduce our logic, it would not be a good long-term solution.
2. They also recongnized that it is not our fault, but a major limitation of Amazon Ads' reporting layer, where our competitors (Meta and Google) already support aggregating such metrics.
* With that conclusion, I decided to Pivot and instead extend the Studies page to surface these metrics.
* I personally continued to drive the long-term discussions of enhancing the reporting layer at the directors level, helping them gather use-cases and requirements.
* With this Pivot, however, our delivery date shifted by 3 months, as now we needed additional planning and reprioritization of tasks and resources.
* But in the end we managed to release this new feature to our customers alas not where we initially planned it to be.

**Reflection**: 
* Looking back, my error in judgment was relying solely on the verbal assurance from the original Engineering Manager without securing a documented consensus
* or technical feasibility assessment involving their senior engineering members.
* Another lesson learned was having plan B readily available, and being ready to pivot without any delay.
* Since this experience, I've introduced formal documentation and alignment processes in cross-team engagements
* and always having contingency plans for complex projects.
