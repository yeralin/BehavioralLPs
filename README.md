### Answer
**S:** At Amazon teams operate according to goals of different levels. For example, S-team goal is one of the most important ones since it is coming from the senior leadership level. Our project was part of an S-team goal to deliver 4 upper funnel metrics. Our team was responsible for delivering Brand Lift metric which would tell you brand awareness levels of your brand using combination of RCT (Randomized Control Trial) A/B experiments and Modeled Brand Lift estimations. The metrics were supposed to be included as part of the Summary Campaign Reports that typically receive majority of traffic from advertisers at Amazon Ads.
However, a month before the release, I received news that the entire S-team goal was deprioritized, and our metric was no longer to be exposed on the report. Instead, the direction from leadership was that we take a pivot and integrate our metric as part of our Studies page which would take at least another 3 months to complete. I quickly realized that it would be a big bummer for my engineering team since they were working hard for the past 6 months to deliver this metric, and many have already anticipated that after the launch the team can take a breather and work on awaited Operational Excellence tasks under less strict timelines.

**T:** My task was to break the news to my team yet to deliver it in a form where they would not lose motivation and lose morale from the fact that their project will extend for another three months.

**A:** First, I worked closely with my Product Manager to brainstorm and pinpoint the Pivot plan. During our analysis, we discovered that by integrating with Studies page that we own, it will give us better insights into how our metrics are being used by customers. As opposed to the Summary Report where we would not get any information on how often our metrics are being accessed and used. Another revelation was that by integrating with the Studies page it would resolve a long-standing technical debt problem that had being bugging our team for a while. This new methodology to Brand Lift measurement would effectively deprecate all other old methodologies, and our PM gave us a green light to simply remove all of them.

**R:** Armed with these insights, I crafted a careful message to my team that I shared during all team meeting where I broke the news to my team about the Pivot plan, and while they were still processing the implications, I shared the findings and communicated that since Amazon is prominent for being Customer Obsessed, we are doing right by our customer by taking the Pivot. It would give us better insights into how our product is being used and give us more feedback to continue quickly iterating and improving our product. I was interjected by one of my SDEs, asking about what would happen regarding our Operational Excellence tasks slated for the remaining of the year. Since I anticipated this question, I also shared the good news with them that with this Pivot, we would deprecate all other Brand Lift solutions effectively eliminating the outstanding tech debt. After, I saw the smiles on my engineers faces, I knew that I delivered the message in the right way. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of patience and thorough analysis before communicating changes. By taking the time to fully understand the implications and craft a clear action plan, I was able to guide the team more effectively through the transition, ultimately maintaining their trust and motivation.
#### Shorter Answer (ChatGPT)
**S:** At Amazon, our team was tasked with delivering a Brand Lift metric as part of an S-team goal. However, a month before the release, leadership decided to deprioritize this initiative, and we were directed to pivot our efforts to integrate the metric into the Studies page, extending our timeline by three months. I knew this change would be demoralizing for my team, who had been working hard for six months with the expectation of completing this milestone.

**T:** My task was to communicate this reframe it in a way that kept the team motivated and aligned with the new direction while addressing their concerns about workload and timelines.

**A:** First, I collaborated with my Product Manager to analyze the benefits of the pivot. We discovered that integrating with the Studies page would provide better insights into how our metrics were used by customers and also eliminate long-standing technical debt. Armed with this, I crafted a clear and empathetic message, presenting the pivot as a customer-obsessed decision aligned with Amazon's principles. I anticipated concerns about delayed operational tasks, so I addressed this directly, explaining how the pivot would actually resolve technical debt and streamline future operations.

**R:** When I communicated the pivot to the team, I framed it as an opportunity to better serve our customers while simultaneously improving our technical infrastructure. Although there was initial hesitation, I handled questions openly, particularly around the impact on our operational tasks. Once I reassured them that this shift would lead to eliminating technical debt, I saw positive reactions and a renewed sense of purpose. The team embraced the change, and we moved forward with a clear focus on delivering the best outcome for our customers. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of patience and thorough analysis before communicating changes. By taking the time to fully understand the implications and craft a clear action plan, I was able to guide the team more effectively through the transition, ultimately maintaining their trust and motivation.
